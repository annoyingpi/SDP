\maketitle

We propose to study the nodal structure of quintic spectrahedra. 
How many nodes can it have on its boundary? 
How many nodes will be real?

We will generate random spectrahedra and compute the positions of nodes. Much
of the code for this is already written. Currently, singular is used to
determine locations of nodes; we hope to replace this by bertini, which will
have better numerical properties.

We also plan to learn what has been done in the case of quartic spectrahedra,
and see if any of that theory generalizes to the quintic case.
